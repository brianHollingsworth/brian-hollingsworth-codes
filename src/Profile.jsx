            <p>If it wasn't apparent by the URL, I'm Brian Hollingsworth. I made
                brian.hollingsworth.codes for a multitude of reasons: I wanted an always-changing
                side project for experimenting with new web frameworks; updating a paper resume felt
                antiquated, and LinkedIn became tiresome. Nothing makes me feel more homogeneous
                than flaunting my profile on the same platform as every other developer out there.</p>
