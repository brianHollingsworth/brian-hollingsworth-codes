Certain employees at UnitedHealth Group require company travel and/or purchasing cards, and the old process for obtaining a card was as follows: internally apply for a card; wait for the request to be approved by a manager; wait for site admins to email the request to our bank affilate; and then wait for our bank affiliate to process the request and send a card in the mail. Notice a trend? There was A LOT of waiting involved. Today, my API directly connects with our bank affiliate\'s processing service. This allows UHG\'s corporate card admins to send as many card requests as they like with a single click.</br></br><u>GDPR:</u> After the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted, UnitedHealth Group put together measures for ensuring personal data of its EU employees is kept for only as long as it is being processed for technical and organizational purposes; after which, that data is deemed \\"in scope\\" for purging. My GDPR program parses identifying information (ID, name, email, etc.) from the \\"in scope\\" data, queries for records of that information against all of UHG\'s platforms, and deletes all instances of those records. The true beauty of my program comes from its modularity; I designed it to dynamically change as UHG\'s presence in Europe expands.

TDP interns are introduced to Optum and UnitedHealth Group by working closely with technology professionals, mentors, and leaders over a 12-week period. I spent the summer of 2016 working as a Java Applications Developer on an internal database application that focused on UnitedHealthcare member activity collection (MAC). To put it in a nutshell, UHC insures <i>a lot</i> of companies, ranging from small family shops with single-digit employees to enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees. The majority of insurance plans involve providing members with monetary compensations when said members complete health-related tasks, like getting a physical. If a member believes his or her compensation is too small, for example, he or she can file a claim to have the compensation corrected. Those claims get sent to data analysts who sift through millions of entries; that\'s where MAC comes in. Without revealing too much, MAC finds and returns all CLOB claim entries based on the parameters provided by an XML template file. MAC then inserts entries for those members who need recompensation, which provides a clear picture of how many insured members need to be justly repaid.","Tenure":"June 2016 - August 2016"},{"key":6,"Title":"Software Engineering Intern","Company":"Maverick Software Consulting","Site":"http://www.mavericksoftware.com/","Icon":"images/Company_Icons/Maverick.png","Description":"The most important job I had during college.
